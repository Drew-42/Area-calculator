# Area-calculator
A program that can calculate the area/volume of various geometric shapes/forms, also capable of unit conversion in the process (metric, imperial).

It's pretty straightforward to use. The most interesting aspect of this program to me is the capability of converting units freely. For example, one may want to calculate the volume of a cuboid. The user can input the length in micrometers, the width in light-years, and the height in yards. The volume can then be calculated and expressed in any metric or imperial unit, such as cubic Roman miles.

The results are displayed with scientific notation.

It was very satisfying to realise that the unit conversion worked as intended, especially for imperial units as well.
